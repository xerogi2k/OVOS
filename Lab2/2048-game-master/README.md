# 2048 Game

This is a simple web-based version of the popular 2D sliding tile app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2048/id840919914">2048</a>. This game was an introduction for me to Node.js.

## Getting Started

### Playing with Highscore Tracking

To play 2048 on your machine with highscores, you must have Node.js installed. If you do not, visit the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">NodeJS website</a> to download.

Then clone the repo to your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/bradymadden97/2048-game
```
Now open a local Node server on your machine with the command:
```
node server.js
```
Open a web browser and enter the following into the navigation bar:
```
localhost:8080
```
### Playing without Highscore Tracking

To play locally without highscore tracking, first clone the repo to your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/bradymadden97/2048-game
```
Open a web browser and navigate to the <b>index.html</b> page in your filesystem

Good luck and enjoy!
